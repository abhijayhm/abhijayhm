## Hi, I’m Abhijay! 👋

I started my journey with web and native app development, building apps like *Resuscitate* that kicked things off. Over time, I shifted my focus to more complex fields like **ROS**, **AI**, and **industrial automation**, while still keeping my hands in web development.

### What I’m up to now:
- **ROS** & autonomous robot driving 🤖  
- **AI research** & mathematical applications (masked as AI, of course) 🧠  
- **Industrial automation** & system optimization ⚙️  
- **Web development**—keeping the fundamentals strong 🌐  

### Interests:
- Exploring all areas of **computer science**:  
    - **Networking** 🌐  
    - **Cybersecurity** 🔒  
    - And yes, anything that involves **problem-solving** 💡  

I’m always learning, building, and breaking things to make them better. Let's collaborate and create something awesome!
